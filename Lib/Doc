HelperFunctions.h:
  It contains some helper function to process the timestamps, calculate the throughput, etc.

HelperFunctions2.h
  It contains two data structures and one self defined scatter function:
    MailBox
    MailRoom
    SELF_DEFINED_SCATTER

  MailBox:
    It is essential a message queue that follows LIFO.
    There is a lock to ensure that there is not race condition.
    fetchMail function is a blocking call. It will not return until the mail box is no longer empty.
      The blocking is implemented via condition_variable.
      Besides, a pointer to the user provided receive buffer is required so that the message is copied from the mailbox to the buffer

  MailRoom:
    It contains up to number of threads per MPI mailboxes
    Each MPI process only has one MailRoom

  SELF_DEFINED_SCATTER:
    Overview:
      Assume 5 MPIs, each with 10 threads
      Sender send data that is destined for that world to each postman (5 postman in total)
      Each postman split the data into 10 chunks and put each chunk into a mailbox (Each mailroom contains 10 mailboxes in total)
      Each thread poll the mail from its mailbox
    Sender Routine:
      Master sends all the messages that are to be sent to that world(MPI) to that world's postman.
    Postman Routine
      After postman receives the messages from the sender,
        it will put the messages into the corresponding mailBoxes in the mailRoom
    Normal Routine
      All the threads in each world will try to fetch mails from their own mailBoxes from each world's mailRoom
