CS267 Paper Structure
1. Abstract
    1. Show the constraints of naive hybrid models
    2. Show how our mailbox model manage to improve the collective functions performance
2. Introduction
3. Background
    1. MPI Operations
        1. Send
        2. Scatter
        3. Broadcast
        4. Gather
    2. MPI Multithread Models
    3. OpenMP
4. Naive Hybrid Model (MPI with OpenMP)
    1. Hard to combine
    2. Low performance (show the P2P results)
    3. Collective functions cannot be used
5. Mailbox Solution
    1. Motivation & high level overview
    2. Algorithm description
    3. Expectation
    4. Easy to use interface (similar to the native MPI function calls)
6. Experiments Results
    1. Environment description
        1. Haswell & KNL specification
    2. P2P
        1. Overview: Really bad performance in terms of scaling
        2. KNL & Haswell has basically the same throughput
        3. Haswell has larger throughput
    3. Scatter
        1. Overview: Naive bad, mailbox much better
        2. When the message size becomes larger, our mailbox loses advantages
        3. The level of thread parallelization goes down, the performance is better as expected
        4. Haswell has larger throughput
    4. Broadcast
        1. Our mailbox is really ineffective (yet still better than vanilla)
        2. MPI broadcast is highly efficient
        3. Haswell has larger throughput
    5. Gather
